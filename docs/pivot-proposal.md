# Pivot Proposal: MCP Context Layer over Google Workspace CLI

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Status:** Discussion draft — assumptions validated

> **Note (2026-04):** The authentication model described in this document (per-user OAuth flow, browser invocation, `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET`, localhost callback server, `gws auth login`) has been replaced by service account domain-wide delegation with JWT signing. The architectural pivot to use `gws` as an execution engine remains valid, but all OAuth-specific auth sections below are historical.

## Problem

Google shipped `@googleworkspace/cli` (gws) — a Rust CLI that dynamically discovers and wraps every Workspace API via Google's Discovery Service. It includes 24 helper commands, structured output, encrypted credential storage, and auto-pagination. At v0.13.1 it's actively maintained under Apache-2.0.

Our project manually maintains TypeScript wrappers around a subset of these same APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts). Every time Google changes an API surface, we update by hand. We're doing work Google now does for free.

**However:** gws removed its MCP server in v0.13.0 and has no multi-account concept. These are our two strongest differentiators.

## What We're Good At

1. **Progressive context disclosure** — surfacing the right tools at the right time instead of dumping 200+ tools on an agent
2. **Multi-account orchestration** — account registry, per-account token lifecycle, automatic renewal
3. **Context-efficient responses** — shaping API responses for AI consumption (attachment caching, response trimming)
4. **MCP protocol serving** — we are the bridge between agents and Google Workspace

## What gws Is Good At

1. **API coverage** — every Workspace API, auto-discovered, never stale
2. **Helper commands** — `+send`, `+reply`, `+triage`, `+upload`, `+agenda` with sensible defaults
3. **Structured output** — JSON/table/yaml/csv, consistent across all services
4. **Auto-pagination** — `--page-all` with rate limiting built in
5. **Credential encryption** — AES-256-GCM with OS keyring integration
6. **Safety** — `--dry-run`, `--sanitize` (Model Armor), path traversal validation

## What We Delete

- `src/modules/calendar/service.ts` — gws handles calendar API calls
- `src/modules/drive/service.ts` — gws handles drive API calls
- `src/modules/gmail/services/*` — gws handles gmail API calls
- `src/modules/contacts/service.ts` — gws handles people API calls
- All Google API type definitions mirroring upstream schemas
- Manual pagination logic (gws `--page-all`)
- Most of `src/tools/definitions.ts` — tool schemas derived from gws capabilities

## What We Keep

- **Account registry** (`accounts.json`) — which accounts exist and their metadata
- **MCP server shell** (`src/tools/server.ts`) — protocol layer, tool dispatch
- **Attachment optimization** (`src/modules/attachments/`) — context-efficient response shaping

## What We No Longer Need

- **OAuth callback server** — gws runs its own localhost callback; we just `xdg-open` the URL
- **Token refresh logic** — gws handles token lifecycle internally
- **Plaintext token storage** — gws uses AES-256-GCM encryption with OS keyring

## What We Build New

- **gws executor** — subprocess wrapper that invokes gws with proper credentials, parses JSON output, maps exit codes
- **Semantic tool router** — instead of 1:1 mapping of API methods to MCP tools, group by intent (e.g., "find information", "send message", "manage files")
- **Context disclosure engine** — dynamically adjusts available tools based on conversation state and account capabilities
- **Credential bridge** — translates our account registry into gws-compatible credential file routing

## Key Design Questions

### 1. Subprocess vs library binding?
**Leaning subprocess.** gws is a Rust binary distributed via npm. Calling it as a subprocess with `--format json` gives us clean structured output. No FFI complexity, easy to version-pin, and gws's exit codes (0-5) map cleanly to error handling.

### 2. How do we handle multi-account with gws?
gws uses `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to select credentials. We maintain our account registry and set this env var per invocation. Our OAuth callback server handles initial auth; we write credentials in gws-compatible format.

### 3. What's the tool surface look like?
Instead of mirroring every API method, we define semantic tools:

| Tool | Maps to gws | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `search_emails` | `gws gmail users messages list` | Find emails |
| `send_email` | `gws gmail +send` | Compose and send |
| `reply_to_email` | `gws gmail +reply` | Thread reply |
| `get_calendar` | `gws calendar +agenda` | Today's schedule |
| `create_event` | `gws calendar +insert` | Schedule meeting |
| `find_files` | `gws drive files list` | Search Drive |
| `upload_file` | `gws drive +upload` | Upload to Drive |
| `read_document` | `gws docs documents get` | Read a Doc |
| ... | ... | ... |

Progressive disclosure means an agent sees `list_accounts` first, then account-relevant tools expand based on what services are available.

### 4. Do we keep our own credential storage or adopt gws's?
**Hybrid.** Our account registry (accounts.json) stays — it tracks which accounts exist and their metadata. But actual OAuth tokens could be stored in gws's encrypted format rather than our plaintext JSON files. This is a security improvement for free.

### 5. What about gws skills?
gws ships 92 skills as SKILL.md files for agent consumption. We could expose these as MCP resources — agents can read the skill docs to understand what's possible before invoking tools. This aligns with progressive disclosure.

## Auth Flow: Browser Invocation

gws prints the OAuth URL to stderr and waits on a localhost callback. It does not open a browser itself. Our wrapper is ~20 lines:

```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';
import open from 'open'; // cross-platform: xdg-open (Linux), open (macOS), start (Windows)

function authenticateAccount(clientId: string, clientSecret: string): Promise<AuthResult> {
  const gws = spawn('gws', ['auth', 'login'], {
    env: { ...process.env,
      GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_ID: clientId,
      GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET: clientSecret
    }
  });

  // Capture auth URL from stderr, open in default browser
  gws.stderr.on('data', (chunk) => {
    const match = chunk.toString().match(/https:\/\/accounts\.google\.com\S+/);
    if (match) open(match[0]);
  });

  // gws prints JSON result to stdout on completion
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    let stdout = '';
    gws.stdout.on('data', (d) => stdout += d);
    gws.on('close', () => resolve(JSON.parse(stdout)));
  });
  // result: { status: 'success', account: 'user@gmail.com', credentials_file: '...' }
}
```

This replaces our entire OAuth module (~500 lines), callback server, and token refresh logic.

## Risks

- **gws stability** — v0.13.2, pre-1.0, API could change. Mitigated by version-pinning in package.json.
- **Subprocess overhead** — each tool call spawns a process. Likely negligible for Workspace API latency, but worth benchmarking.
- **"Not officially supported"** — Google's disclaimer. But it's active, has multiple contributors, and the Google DevRel team maintains it.

## What This Buys Us

1. **Coverage expansion overnight** — Sheets, Docs, Slides, Chat, Meet, Admin, Classroom, Forms, Keep, Tasks — all accessible without writing a single API wrapper
2. **Zero API maintenance** — Discovery Service means gws auto-updates when Google changes things
3. **Smaller codebase** — delete ~60% of current TypeScript, replace with thin executor layer
4. **Security improvement** — gws's encrypted credential storage vs our plaintext tokens
5. **Focus on our differentiator** — progressive context disclosure and multi-account orchestration, not API plumbing

## Validation Results (2026-03-13)

| Assumption | Result |
|---|---|
| gws installs via npx | **Confirmed** — v0.13.2, runs without issues |
| Our OAuth client works with gws | **Confirmed** — `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CLIENT_ID` accepted |
| gws auth flow stores encrypted credentials | **Confirmed** — `~/.config/gws/credentials.enc` (AES-256-GCM) |
| Live Calendar API calls | **Confirmed** — events returned with full structured JSON |
| Live Gmail API calls | **Confirmed** — `+triage` returned inbox summary |
| gws helper commands work | **Confirmed** — `+triage` produces formatted table output |
| Credential format: `authorized_user` JSON | **Confirmed** — `{ type, client_id, client_secret, refresh_token }` |
| Browser auth is just URL capture + open | **Confirmed** — gws prints URL to stderr, runs localhost callback |

**Removed from risk list:** Credential format compatibility — verified working.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Validate credential format compatibility~~ — done
2. Test multi-account credential routing via env var (needs second account auth)
3. Prototype the gws executor — subprocess call, JSON parse, error mapping
4. Design the semantic tool registry
5. Write the ADR and start the rewrite
